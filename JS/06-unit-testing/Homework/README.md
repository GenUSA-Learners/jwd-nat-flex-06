# JS-6 JavaScript Unit Testing Using Mocha

Participants will go through an overview of unit testing, why it's important and how to use it in JavaScript.

## Behavioral Skills & Mindsets Connections

***Future Orientation*** is important to learn Unit Testing because creating unit tests when developing a new project enables a developer to catch bugs before they become a problem, and makes it much easier to scale and adapt a piece of code in the future

Detail Orientation is important to learn Unit Testing because developers must be capable of catching all possible failures before they even happen, and this requires paying great amount of attention to detail

## Performance Goals Connections

- Use coding best practices to execute assigned tasks
- Proactively learn new technical and non-technical skills in order to improve performance and increase the likelihood of a promotion

## Homework + Learning Objectives

<!-- Note: Each module assigned in Codecademy is expected to be completed in full. This includes multiple lessons, projects and quizzes if they appear in the module assigned. The link in this repo only links to the first item in the module. Continue to click through the lessons, projects, quizzes and articles until the module is 100% complete, unless explicitly stated otherwise  -->
